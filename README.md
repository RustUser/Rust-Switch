# Rust-Switch
Rust Switch is a simple library that provides a very simple structure that is used to wrap the boolean data type, switching it's value after it has been used.

I have provided a simple example as to where the structure can be used.

For example:

If you have a system where you need to take a boolean, and invert its value after it is used, this is the perfect implementation of this switch structure, as it does it for you.
